# Probability-Distributions
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the analysis and visualization of various probability distributions.
The notebook is designed to help learners and practitioners understand the core concepts of probability distributions, their properties, and applications in data analysis.

Contents
Introduction to Probability Distributions:

Overview of probability theory and its importance in statistics.
Explanation of key concepts like random variables, expected value, and variance.
Discrete Distributions:

Bernoulli Distribution: Analyzing binary outcomes (success/failure).
Binomial Distribution: Exploring the distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.
Continuous Distributions:

Normal Distribution: Understanding the bell curve, standard deviation, and the empirical rule.
T-Distribution: Comparison with the normal distribution and its application in small sample sizes.
Visualization Techniques:

Plotting probability mass functions (PMFs) and probability density functions (PDFs).
Visual comparisons between different distributions to highlight key differences.
Applications and Examples:

Practical examples of how these distributions are used in real-world data analysis.
Interpretation of distribution curves in the context of statistical inference.
